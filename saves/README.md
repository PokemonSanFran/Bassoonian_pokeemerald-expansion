# Testing Process
0) Play through game, make a save
1) Run `make release` to create v1 
2) Run [`oldSaveGet`](https://github.com/PokemonSanFran/Bassoonian_pokeemerald-expansion/blob/psf_tests/saves/1_rival1/oldSaveGet) from gdb to get the saveblock as [`oldSave.txt`](https://github.com/PokemonSanFran/Bassoonian_pokeemerald-expansion/blob/psf_tests/saves/1_rival1/oldSave.txt).
3) Perform first [modification](https://github.com/PokemonSanFran/Bassoonian_pokeemerald-expansion/tree/psf_tests/saves#modifications) to saveblocks
4) Run `make release` to create v2
5) Run [`newSaveGet`](https://github.com/PokemonSanFran/Bassoonian_pokeemerald-expansion/blob/psf_tests/saves/1_rival1/newSaveGet) from gdb to get the saveblock as `newSave.txt`.
6) Compare `oldSave.txt` and `newSavetxt`, then proceed if matching as expected
7) Perform second [modification](https://github.com/PokemonSanFran/Bassoonian_pokeemerald-expansion/tree/psf_tests/saves#modifications) to saveblocks
8) Run `make release` to create v3
9) Compare `oldSave.txt` and `newSavetxt`, then proceed if matching as expected

## Test Status
### [`add_add`](https://github.com/PokemonSanFran/Bassoonian_pokeemerald-expansion/commits/add_add/include/global.h)

This diff [compares](https://www.diffchecker.com/nGlrzt99/) v1 saveblock and v2 saveblock. When resuming the game, things seem fine, but when directly printing the saveblock, it appears to be corrupted.

# Testing Different Saves

## Setup

From the root directory of this repo, run the following:

`chmod +x load_save.sh`

## Swapping Saves

To load a save, run the following from the root directory:

`./load_save.sh NUM_SAVE`

and then open the game. Replace `NUM_SAVE` with the save file you want to load. For example, `1` corresponds to `1_rival1`.
